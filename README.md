# 📘 Night Shift Work and Health Risk Analysis

## 📄 Project Overview

This project investigates the correlation between night shift work and health-related risks using data visualization techniques. The analysis focuses on identifying trends in sleep patterns, chronic conditions, and lifestyle habits of individuals who work night shifts. The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard providing insights to employers, researchers, and policymakers to improve worker wellbeing.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes anonymized health records of individuals working various shifts. It contains features such as:

* `Shift_Type` (Day/Night)
* `Sleep_Hours`
* `Chronic_Disease` (Yes/No)
* `BMI`
* `Exercise_Frequency`
* `Smoking_Habit`
* `Age`
* `Gender`

Source: Synthetic/generated for project purpose

## 📈 Exploratory Analysis Summary

* Night shift workers had reported **less sleep** on average than day shift workers.
* A greater proportion of night shift workers reported **chronic health issues** (e.g., hypertension, obesity).
* **BMI levels** tended to be higher among night workers.
* **Smoking and low physical activity** were more common in the night shift population.

## 🤖 Modeling Results

* Avg Sleep Hours by Shift
* % with Chronic Disease by Shift Type

```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download the `.pbix` file from the repository.
2. Open in Power BI Desktop.
3. Use the slicers to interact with filters like gender, shift type, or age group.
